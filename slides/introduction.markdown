### Introduction

This lab walks you through some different components of the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps" target="_blank">Maps API</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target=_blank">JavaScript</a>.

Most websites are built from a combination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target=_blank">HTML</a> (content) and JavaScript (behaviour). We want to focus on programming, so each exercise contains pre-built HTML.

Click **Run** to execute the code in the editor.

Click **Show Elements** to view the IDs of each HTML element in the output page.

By default any code you change will be saved. Click **Reset** to discard these changes.
